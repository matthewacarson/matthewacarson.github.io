I graduated *summa cum laude* in June 2024 from the University of California, Los Angeles, with a BA in Sociology and Political Science. During my senior year, I completed two senior theses, one in sociology and the other in political science. Both theses won the best thesis prize in the respective department.

My sociology thesis was a historical-comparative analysis of union organizing strategies, with a focus on construction unions. I examined how their relationships with employers shape their comparatively employer-friendly political stances and how their organizing model weakens their ability to challenge management and defend workers’ interests.

My political science thesis explored the relationship between economic inequality, gentrification, and police killings. Using census tract household income data and the Urban Displacement Project’s gentrification typologies, I analyzed how interactions between race, economic inequality, and gentrification influence the probability of police killings. I hope this research contributes to a better understanding of the phenomenon and how to combat it.

The sociology thesis was a historical-comparative project that analyzed the different methods of organizing that unions use. In particular, I am interested in how construction unions organize and establish relations with employers and how that corresponds with political stances that are more employer-friendly than other unions. Additionally, I am interested in how the construction union method of organizing places construction unions in a weaker position that hinders their ability to challenge management and defend workers’ interests.

The political science thesis examined the relationship between economic inequality, gentrification, and police killings using census tract household income and the Urban Displacement Project’s gentrification typologies. In addition, I looked at the interactions between the victim’s race and the racial composition of the census tract. My hope is that this project contributes to a better understanding of the phenomenon and how to combat it. -->
