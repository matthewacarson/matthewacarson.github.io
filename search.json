    "text": "In a previous post I introduced the first batch of plots showing how the rates of police killings vary across median incomes in census tracts relative to their median county income, basically a measure of income where a police killing occurred relative to the county income.\nInstead of using relative measures, this time I am using absolute income values and breaking them into quintiles. I’m also displaying a lot more information on single plots, so that should make the implications more discernible for readers.\nAdditionally, I’m beginning to look at the Urban Displacement Project’s (UDP) data set. As of this writing, the data are limited to a handful of regions, but it’s still broad enough that I can make an initial plot. In a future post, I’ll extend the analysis beyond the 6 regions currently in the data set: Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle and their surrounding cities.\n\n\nThe plot above emphasizes how the rates of police killings vary within tracts in the same income quintile by racial/ethnic majorities. Notice how the rates vary more across income quintiles than across racial groups. The next plot, displaying the same data except emphasizing the variation within racial/ethnic groups will illustrate this point even more clearly.\n\n\nNext, I’ll share the initial plot using the gentrification data from the UDP. It looks like tracts that are at-risk of gentrification have experienced the highest rates.\n\nHere is the UDP typology."

    "text": "I graduated in June 2024 from the University of California, Los Angeles, summa cum laude, with a double major in Sociology and Political Science. During my senior year, I completed two senior theses, one in sociology, the other in political science. Both theses won the best thesis prize in the respective department.\nThe sociology thesis was a historical-comparative project that analyzed the different methods of organizing that unions use. In particular, I am interested in how construction unions organize and establish relations with employers and how that corresponds with political stances that are more employer-friendly than other unions. Additionally, I am interested in how the construction union method of organizing places construction unions in a weaker position that hinders their ability to challenge management and defend workers’ interests.\nThe political science thesis examined the relationship between economic inequality, gentrification, and police killings using census tract household income and the Urban Displacement Project’s gentrification typologies. In addition, I looked at the interactions between race of the victim and the racial composition of the census tract. My hope is that this project contributes to a better understanding of the phenomenon.\n\nDownload CV"

    "text": "I’m working on a project analyzing various class indicators (or levels of deprivation/privilege, if you prefer) in census tracts1 where someone was killed by law enforcement.2\nThere is a longer history of the debate around whether or not police killings are a function of capitalist political economy and the managing of the “surplus population” or whether the phenomenon largely derives from discrimination against black Americans3. I may return to this in more detail in a future post, but for now I wanted to share the plots I have made for my honors thesis project. Hopefully someone will find them useful in helping us to better understand the phenomenon. Any feedback is appreciated.4\nThe following plot shows the per 10 million rate of police killings in census tracts based on their median household income as a proportion of the county median household income in which they are situated. I used this measure rather than raw incomes to adjust for differences in what is considered low income and high income.5\nThis plot shows that the incidence of police killings varies quite a lot depending on tract income level. Low income tracts experience a rate nearly twice that of average income tracts, and high income tracts experience a rate less than one-third of low income tracts.\nThis plot is constructed the same as the one above, except that it is subset to only include tracts with a white population &gt; 50%. The rates were similar to the plot above except for the low income tracts.\nAnother plot subset to only include tracts with a black population &gt; 50%. The rates for low income and moderate-low income were quite a bit higher than average or greater income. Average to high income tracts had roughly the same rate.\nLatino/Hispanic-majority tracts. Pretty clear trend here as well. The higher the income, the lower the rate.\nIn majority-Asian tracts the lowest income tracts also experienced the highest rate with higher income tracts experiencing lower rates except high income tracts had a rate greater than moderate-high tracts.\nNext I looked at tracts in which there was no racial or ethnic majority, but more than one race/ethnicity comprised &gt; 30% of the population.\nWhite-black tracts.\nWhite-Hispanic/Latino\nBlack-Hispanic/Latino. (No police killings occurred in high income tracts.)\nUpdate (7/26): I just want to add a plot that shows all the majority one race rates together:\nHere is the table with the rates.\nRace\nIncome Level\nTotal Population\n# of Police Killings\nAverage per Year\nPer 10 Million Person-years\n\n\n\n\nA\nAverage\n756235\n9\n1.5000000\n19.835104\n\n\nA\nHigh\n1142337\n11\n1.8333333\n16.048971\n\n\nA\nLow\n568765\n9\n1.5000000\n26.372931\n\n\nA\nModerate-High\n600245\n5\n0.8333333\n13.883220\n\n\nA\nModerate-Low\n574605\n8\n1.3333333\n23.204346\n\n\nA\nUnknown\n15139\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nAH\nAverage\n287183\n10\n1.6666667\n58.035004\n\n\nAH\nHigh\n175125\n2\n0.3333333\n19.034023\n\n\nAH\nLow\n218377\n6\n1.0000000\n45.792368\n\n\nAH\nModerate-High\n167022\n3\n0.5000000\n29.936176\n\n\nAH\nModerate-Low\n328824\n5\n0.8333333\n25.342838\n\n\nAH\nUnknown\n26\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nB\nAverage\n3277934\n58\n9.6666667\n29.490120\n\n\nB\nHigh\n1306465\n20\n3.3333333\n25.514142\n\n\nB\nLow\n10061133\n494\n82.3333333\n81.833063\n\n\nB\nModerate-High\n1736993\n30\n5.0000000\n28.785378\n\n\nB\nModerate-Low\n5144285\n152\n25.3333333\n49.245587\n\n\nB\nUnknown\n238475\n7\n1.1666667\n48.921970\n\n\nBA\nAverage\n21324\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nBA\nHigh\n19647\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nBA\nLow\n52918\n3\n0.5000000\n94.485808\n\n\nBA\nModerate-High\n28913\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nBA\nModerate-Low\n8478\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nBH\nAverage\n316018\n8\n1.3333333\n42.191690\n\n\nBH\nHigh\n137442\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nBH\nLow\n1385288\n56\n9.3333333\n67.374678\n\n\nBH\nModerate-High\n187009\n2\n0.3333333\n17.824454\n\n\nBH\nModerate-Low\n706614\n25\n4.1666667\n58.966659\n\n\nBH\nUnknown\n42508\n1\n0.1666667\n39.208306\n\n\nH\nAverage\n6617160\n181\n30.1666667\n45.588541\n\n\nH\nHigh\n2966472\n56\n9.3333333\n31.462739\n\n\nH\nLow\n12482813\n498\n83.0000000\n66.491423\n\n\nH\nModerate-High\n3166311\n66\n11.0000000\n34.740744\n\n\nH\nModerate-Low\n10308869\n312\n52.0000000\n50.442003\n\n\nH\nUnknown\n159463\n6\n1.0000000\n62.710472\n\n\nNA\nAverage\n4345624\n99\n16.5000000\n37.969231\n\n\nNA\nHigh\n3307656\n54\n9.0000000\n27.209601\n\n\nNA\nLow\n4803133\n177\n29.5000000\n61.418245\n\n\nNA\nModerate-High\n2983665\n56\n9.3333333\n31.281439\n\n\nNA\nModerate-Low\n5212294\n110\n18.3333333\n35.173253\n\n\nNA\nUnknown\n209091\n16\n2.6666667\n127.536176\n\n\nW\nAverage\n56688110\n1096\n182.6666667\n32.223101\n\n\nW\nHigh\n60786693\n657\n109.5000000\n18.013811\n\n\nW\nLow\n16293469\n461\n76.8333333\n47.155909\n\n\nW\nModerate-High\n45173294\n724\n120.6666667\n26.711948\n\n\nW\nModerate-Low\n37231765\n903\n150.5000000\n40.422473\n\n\nW\nUnknown\n598252\n14\n2.3333333\n39.002516\n\n\nWA\nAverage\n725798\n6\n1.0000000\n13.777938\n\n\nWA\nHigh\n1207621\n4\n0.6666667\n5.520496\n\n\nWA\nLow\n252639\n3\n0.5000000\n19.791085\n\n\nWA\nModerate-High\n638750\n7\n1.1666667\n18.264840\n\n\nWA\nModerate-Low\n514456\n8\n1.3333333\n25.917344\n\n\nWA\nUnknown\n24595\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nWAH\nAverage\n2356\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nWAH\nHigh\n4040\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nWAH\nModerate-High\n6370\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nWAH\nModerate-Low\n3725\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nWB\nAverage\n1673154\n29\n4.8333333\n28.887558\n\n\nWB\nHigh\n773203\n9\n1.5000000\n19.399821\n\n\nWB\nLow\n2065931\n78\n13.0000000\n62.925625\n\n\nWB\nModerate-High\n872883\n17\n2.8333333\n32.459486\n\n\nWB\nModerate-Low\n2030464\n42\n7.0000000\n34.474879\n\n\nWB\nUnknown\n95110\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nWBH\nAverage\n9868\n1\n0.1666667\n168.896095\n\n\nWBH\nHigh\n2043\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nWBH\nLow\n59452\n2\n0.3333333\n56.067640\n\n\nWBH\nModerate-Low\n37333\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nWH\nAverage\n2970689\n60\n10.0000000\n33.662225\n\n\nWH\nHigh\n2070409\n43\n7.1666667\n34.614739\n\n\nWH\nLow\n2463263\n144\n24.0000000\n97.431740\n\n\nWH\nModerate-High\n1881275\n48\n8.0000000\n42.524352\n\n\nWH\nModerate-Low\n3302617\n83\n13.8333333\n41.885975\n\n\nWH\nUnknown\n41803\nNA\nNA\nNA"
