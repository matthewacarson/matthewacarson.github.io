    "text": "Hi. My name is Matt Carson. I am an undergraduate studying sociology and political science at UCLA. I started this blog so that I would have a place to share my thoughts on two research projects I am currently working on.\nOne project, that largely takes a historical-comparative approach, looks at construction and building trade unions in the United States and their distinct mode of organizing and collective bargaining, how that it emerged and evolved over time, what makes it distinct from other craft unions, and what the political implications of those differences are.\nThe other project investigates the phenomenon of lethal uses of police force in the United States. I use various class indicators (or levels of deprivation/privilege, if you prefer) in census tracts in which someone was killed by law enforcement Fundamentally, I am interested in how class position affects one’s likeihood of being killed by law enforcement and how that varies across different racial and ethnic groups. I also intend to assess gentrification’s impact on increased rates of lethal police force. This project is largely quantitative in nature, but I do ground my analysis historically in the emergence of postwar, urban policing."

    "text": "I’m working on a project analyzing various class indicators (or levels of deprivation/privilege, if you prefer) in which someone was killed by law enforcement.\nThere is a longer history of the debate around whether or not police killings are a function of capitalist political economy and the managing of the “surplus population” or whether the phenomenon largely derives from discrimination against black Americans. I may return to this in more detail in a future post, but for now I wanted to share the plots I have made for the honors thesis project. Hopefully someone will find them useful in helping us to better understand the phenomenon. Any feedback is appreciated.\n[plots here]"
