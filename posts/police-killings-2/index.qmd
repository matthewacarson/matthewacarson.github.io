In a [previous post](../police-killings-1) I introduced the first batch of plots showing how the rates of police killings vary across median incomes in census tracts relative to their median county income, basically a measure of income where a police killing occurred relative to the county income.

Instead of using relative measures, this time I am using absolute income values and breaking them into quintiles. I'm also displaying a lot more information on single plots, so that should make the implications more discernible for readers.

Additionally, I'm beginning to look at the [Urban Displacement Project's](https://www.urbandisplacement.org/) (UDP) data set. As of this writing, the data are limited to a handful of regions, but it's still broad enough that I can make an initial plot. In a future post, I'll extend the analysis beyond the 6 regions currently in the data set: Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle and their surrounding cities.

The plot above emphasizes how the rates of police killings vary within tracts in the same income quintile by racial/ethnic majorities. Notice how the rates vary more across income quintiles than across racial groups. The next plot, displaying the same data except emphasizing the variation within racial/ethnic groups will illustrate this point even more clearly.

Next, I'll share the initial plot using the gentrification data from the UDP. It looks like tracts that are at-risk of gentrification have experienced the highest rates.

Here is the UDP typology.
